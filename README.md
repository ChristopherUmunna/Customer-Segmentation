# Customer Segmentation

This project is a Python notebook that performs customer segmentation on telco data using clustering techniques.

## Project Description

The project aims to divide customers into groups according to common characteristics like transaction type, id, days since last transaction product type and product category. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data to find patterns and trends.
- **Model Building**: Building the clustering model to segment customers.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the results of the clustering.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
